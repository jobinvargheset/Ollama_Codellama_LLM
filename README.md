This project aims at installing codellama on local PC and then deploy using gradio on the web browser. This LLM on local machine is exclusively made for giving answers on coding and doesnot have access to weather data 
"app.py" is python program for back end working and also front end (gradio)
"modelfile" controls the codellama by providing prompting and adjusting creativity (temperature =1)
"requirements.py" is to install the dependencies required for smoothly running this LLM on local machine
I have run this code on visualstudiocode IDE
